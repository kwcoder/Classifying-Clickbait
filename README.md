# Classifying-Clickbait: A Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning Models for Headline Similarity Detection
This repository contains the files submitted for my Individual Research Project as part of my MSc Data Science course, for which I was awarded a Merit.

**Project Summary**

This project systematically compares the accuracy of various combinations of supervised learning models and vectorisation techniques. The analysis is applied to a dataset of similar headlines discussing the same event but from different temporal perspectives and with varying focuses. 

**Contents**

  * Data Cleaning
  * Data Inspection
  * Data Preprocessing
  * Vectorisation techniques
  * Model Training and Evaluation
  * Results Visualisation
  * Written Report

I plan to divide this repository into two branches: one containing the original project submission (/original_submission) and another for the improved, extended version (/main).
